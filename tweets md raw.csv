How This Week’s Prop 8 Decision Debunks Five Arguments Against Marriage Equality http://t.co/YJTVewuu via @thinkprogress
So couples who can.t or won.t procreate should have their marriages invalidated?
"Derek, I dont want marriage changed for my benefit. I.m straight. This isn.t 4 my benefit. This is an issue of equal rights for all. #MDSSM"
The truth is a 50% failure rate among heterosexual marriages
"@EqualityMD How about the Catholics rename their marriages ""Catholic Unions"" and we use marriage for same-sex couples and non-Catholics?"
Are you following today.s committee hearing on  the marriage equality bill? Annapolis is heating up- very interesting.

"Del Simmons: you show no evidence of how #MDSSM affects your marriage and families, you just don.t like it”"

"Gay marriage hearing still going strong. Comments limited to three minutes, but room is still full. #MDSSM"
"@DelegateKaiser ""marriage. Nothing more, nothing less."" happy birthday, Delegate. Let.s hope your wish comes true. #MDSSM"

Sen Raskin: Marriage is a contract w/300+ state rights; 1000+ fed rights -- seems like everyone can marry except same-sex couples.
The debate on marriage equality just started.  Sen. Jamie Raskin is the floor leader and offering a strong opening argument.
"Sen Raskin: Cops & firefighters pleading for right to share civil marriage protection w/ partner, even though risk their lives for community"
Sen Miller asks for amendments on HB438 -- amendments are brought to Senate Presidents desk.
Opponent Senators sent letter to AG.s office objecting to earlier amdmts.  Want to move sl-o-o-o-o-o-wly to make sure all options considered
Sen Raskin: Amendments were earlier considered by JPR & defeated.  Add.l concerns are really just delay and stall.  #TellingTheTruth
"Sen Miller: We know where all the votes are on this bill, open to debating the bill.  Adopts fav JPR report & lays bill over until tomorrow"

Senator calls out inappropriate invective that kids were subjected to as a result of testimony for marriage equality bill-calls for civility
Sen Raskin: Explaining the amendments to marriage bill accepted in the House debate.
"Recall: opponents want to pass ANY amendment, since that forces bill back to the House & delay progress.  Playing procedure - not substance."
Coming down the legislative homestretch in gay marriage debate #mdssm
In anticipation of re-districtricting - Del Don Dwyer seems to have a new job and is lurking among press corps in the Senate during debate.
Sen Reilly withdraws amendment after Sen Raskin answers questions.  Weird.
"Sen  Muse:  Asserts civil marriage is not under attack & needs no protection. Doesn.t like title of bill. Complains about ""redefinition""...."
"Sen Muse: Wants to ""redefine"" title of bill to make sure NO votes on marriage bill don.t hurt marriage.s feelings. Not worried abt SScouples"
Sen Muse amendment fails: 30-17
Sen Muse :Worried that bill doesn.t provide enough exemptions for religious organizations to ignore marriages of same-sex couples.
"Sen Jamie Raskin serving as floor leader for the debate -- encourages body to call the question, points out that amendment is vacant."
Sen Shank: Brings up Ocean Grove NJ case and misrepresents as a problem associated with marriage promotion.
Sen Reilly: Worries about sscouples bringing child for Baptism. Has NOTHING to do with marriage -- but wants right to turn away child. Nice.
Second Sen Muse amendment FAILS 17 - 30.
Sen  Reilly: Worried about colleges having to offer housing to married sscouples. Again...has NOTHING to do with marriage.
Next amendmnt: Worried that stories in school curric will be co-opted. Raskin recalls no math problems dealing with marriage in grade school
i have never see any marriage reference in schools and i have 5 kids in school. #mdssm
Sen Simonaire: Asserts bill will make sscouple marriage = to opposite couple marriage.  And that this is bad for kids.
"Simonaire: Wants kids to be able to optout of class whenever ""homosexual material"" is discussed in grade school. Reads dangerous lit to body"
Simonaire: Reading fairy tails to Senate. Seeks to scare members about possibility that gay & lesbian people might fall in love & marry.
Sen Delores Kelly: Defends MD school curriculum as having little to do with marriage-- say amendment has no place on the bill.
We have rejected four amendments so far.  We are on the fifth one banning the use of any material containing a mention of same sex marriage.
"Listen live to the #Marryland Senate debate civil marriage: http://t.co/2xrZWKbq and click ""Current Senate Proceedings."" #MDssm #LGBT #P2"
Sen  Middleton:Point out bullying of g/l children or kids w/ss parents due to continued exclusion of discussion of them & their families
Sen Raskin asks if Sen Middleton wants to ban Sen Madaleno from schools because that would be introding homosexuality in schools ?
Sen Raskin asks if Sen Simonaire wants to ban Sen Madaleno from schools bcs that would be introducing homosexuality in schools (Sorry Mac !)
Sen Simonaire amendment fails 17-30. There !
"Simonaire: News flash: ""Two men gettin. married will never equal one mother"". *pearls of wisdom*"
Sen Crazy asserts that Mother.s Day was repealed in DC public schools.
Sen Kathy Klausmeier: Reminds that Board of Ed makes curriculum - not the MD General Assembly.

Sen Miller not happy - some Senators still missing.  Oy !!
HB 438 is called for 3rd reader - Sen Simonaire starts things off.
Sen Simonaire amendment: NOW he.s worried about equality - doesn.t want men & women to have diff rights in civil marriage.
Simonnaire worried that SS couples won.t have same rights as opposite couples. Really ?  (maybe you could co-spon ?)
"Sen Brinkley: I.m not really interested in passing the bill - but if you are going to do it, it shouldn.t be imperfect."
"Sen Simonnaire now advocating for equality for same sex couples in civil marriage law. Except for ""who.s the wife"" in SS couple ?"
"Simonnaire: wants to know which spouse in SS couple gets to be the wife, which gets to be the husband ?"
@Mandalaca so having set that precedence we also intend to be first same sex couple married in our county as well. :-) just a matter of time
Can.t make this stuff up folks.....
"Sen DeGrange offers amdmt that allows anyone with ""sincerely held religious belief"" to discriminate -  incl current anti-discrim categories."
Sen Peters: Wants to know if churches that host polling places....can do what ?
"Sen Peters: His evangelical church that has rental property - will they have to host ""same-sex activities"" ?"
"Sen Peters: Wants to know if Elks, Moose Lodge have to accomodate same sex couples ? (What does this have to do with civil marriage ?)"
Listen to the proceedings #mdssm #equalmarriage #lgbtq http://t.co/con1sTBo  #makinghistory #andherstory
Senators have lots of questions about public accommodation for same-sex couples.

Sen Muse speaking in favor of amendment that permits religious orgs to ignore anti-discrim law http://t.co/8vYo62aD
"Sen Madaleno: if you needed marriage counseling, would you go to a counselor who doesn.t think you should be married ?"
Sen Reilly: Says amendment only for protection of religious freedoms - just added protection ( like Right Guard)
"Sen Brinkley: Got letter about ""conscience exemptions"" from Robin Fretwell Wilson - who claims neutrality, but only reps for anti equality"
Sen Brinkley: Traditional man-woman marriage is ordained and sanctioned by God.
@EqualityMD When/where is it mentioned in Buddhism that this faith is against gay marriage???
"Senator Brinkley is reading a long letter that asks for ""broad conscience clause"" to let people deny services to same sex couples. #mdssm"
Sen Brinkley: Only reading the letter - not the footnotes. Thoughtful.

@ethangrayson All of the referendum issues need more volunteer support including defending traditional marriage.
@ethangrayson The hostility is expressed by your opinion that marriage itself has no value in a civil society ie the govt should stay out.
@ethangrayson The institution of marriage has existed for millienia even in free societies.  It has value but you know better I guess.
@ethangrayson If I misrepresented your position I apologize. Should the government regulate or even involve itself in marriage?

Good question. Maybe Mitt will explain. RT @MHarrisPerry: Marriage solves gun violence?
#debate I think Mitt just supported marriage equality by stating that children of 2 loving parents less likely to grow up violent. Exactly!
Single women who have babies (and have sex out side of marriage): you are responsible for violence and poverty in America according to Mitt
"So Romney is for gay marriage? “@mattvindaloo: Get married, win an AK-47. Romney.s America.”"
So the cure for gun viol. is for more marriages  procreation so long as they consist of a mom & dad I might as well give my kid her 1st ak47
